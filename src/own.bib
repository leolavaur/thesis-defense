  abstract     = {In 2016, Google introduced the concept of Federated Learning (FL), enabling collaborative Machine Learning (ML). FL does not share local data but ML models, offering applications in diverse domains. This paper focuses on the application of FL to Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). There, common criteria to compare existing solutions are missing. In particular, this survey shows: (i) how FL-based IDSs are used in different domains; (ii) what differences exist between architectures; (iii) the state of the art of FL-based IDS. With a structured literature survey, this work identifies the relevant state of the art in FL--based intrusion detection from its creation in 2016 until 2021. It provides a reference architecture and a taxonomy to serve as guidelines to compare and design FL- based IDSs. Both are validated with the existing works. Finally, it identifies research directions for the application of FL to intrusion detection systems.}
